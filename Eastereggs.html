</div>

<div>
This is called "the answer to life the universe and everything"
</div>

<div>
When you search "the answer to life the universe and everything", Google shows the number 42. Since Google owns a third of the internet I'm willing to belive them.
</div>

<img src="https://searchengineland.com/figz/wp-content/seloads/2018/10/4-google-easter-egg-zergrush-600x354.png" alt="game from seachengineland from an article written by Chris Sherman" width="300" height="250" title="seachengineland By:Chris Sherman">
</div>

<div>
This is called "Zerg Rush"
</div>

<div>
When you search "Zerg Rush", Google starts off normally, however, a few seconds later little balls that are red or yellow come and eat the page, the user can fight the balls by clicking them until they die. Ti've played the game multiple times and lost, every single time.
</div>

<div>
<img src="https://searchengineland.com/figz/wp-content/seloads/2018/10/2-google-easter-egg-recursion-600x357.png" alt="rec from seachengineland from an article written by Chris Sherman" width="300" height="250" title="seachengineland By:Chris Sherman">
</div>

<div>
This is called "Recursion"
</div>

<div>
When you search for "Recursion", Google sends you to the definition of recursion, but it will you "misspelled it" and when you click the "correction" the page reloads and the same thing happens. It is a infinite cycle.
</div>

<div>
<img src="https://searchengineland.com/figz/wp-content/seloads/2018/10/15-google-easter-egg-blue-moon-600x254.png" alt="moon from seachengineland from an article written by Chris Sherman" width="300" height="250" title="seachengineland By:Chris Sherman">
</div>

<div>
This is called "Once in a Blue Moon"
</div>

<div>
If you google "once in a blue moon", you get 1.16699016 * 10^-8 hertz. I don't really know what this means thought, but appearently if you convert herzts to years you get 2.7 years which is approximatly the amount of time between each blue moon"
</div>

<div>
<img src="https://searchengineland.com/figz/wp-content/seloads/2018/10/16-google-easter-egg-blue-heart-graph-540x400.png"alt="heart from seachengineland from an article written by Chris Sherman" width="300"
height="250" title="seachengineland By:Chris Sherman">
</div>

<div>
This is called "heart"
</div>

<div>
The search to get this one is really weird, but if you search "sqrt(cos(x))*cos(300x)+sqrt(abs(x))-0.7)*(4-x*x)^0.01, sqrt(6-x^2), -sqrt(6-x^2) from -4.5 to 4.5" into the google search bar you get a graph that shows a heart. This would be cooler if it was only shown on Valentine's day, but I'm not complaining.
</div>

<img src="https://searchengineland.com/figz/wp-content/seloads/2018/10/11-google-easter-egg-conway-life-600x304.png" alt="game of life from seachengineland from an article written by Chris Sherman" width="300" height="250" title="seachengineland By:Chris Sherman">
</div>

<div>
This is called "Conway's Game of Life"
</div>

<div>
If you search "conway's game of life" into the google search bar, random tiny squares start appearing which is supposed to simulate life and the evolution of cells and how they interact with each other over time. This is based on the mathematician John Horton Conway's game. The game is a "Zero-player game" and the user has no affect on what happens to the cells. To be honest this is pretty boring to watch, but the idea is pretty cool.

<img src="https://searchengineland.com/figz/wp-content/seloads/2018/10/7-google-easter-egg-play-snake-600x396.png" alt="snake from seachengineland from an article written by Chris Sherman" width="300" height="250" title="seachengineland By:Chris Sherman">
</div>

<div>
This is called "Snake"
</div>

<div>
If you search "play snake" you get to play Google's version of snake which has way better graphics than the orginal snake. The game is based around you, the snake, eating apples and getting bigger in a confined space. If you hit a wall or yourself, you die and have to restart. This game is one of the funest that Google can offer. I've played it multiple times and I highly recommend it.

<img src="https://searchengineland.com/figz/wp-content/seloads/2018/10/6-google-easter-egg-pacman-594x400.png" alt="pacman from seachengineland from an article written by Chris Sherman" width="300" height="250" title="seachengineland By:Chris Sherman">
</div>

<div>
This is called "Pac-Man Doodle"
</div>

<div>
If you search "play pacman" you get to play Google's version of pacman. This version has 1 level that is based around the Google logo. To win the game you need to gather all the dots, like the orginal Pac-Man. Once you win, you play the level again, but with the score you've attained from the first level. This game is pretty fun and short if you only play the first level. I myself have played it multiple times and won like the pro gamer I am.
