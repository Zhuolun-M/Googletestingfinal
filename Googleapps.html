Google Translate is a translation app developed by Google. It contains a lot of different languages like Chinese to English to Greek. It's not always accurate though. You can download it on your phone or just go to google and search "google translate". It helps with any language classes.

Google Maps is an app that allows you to navigate where you want to go. If you plug in a location you Google Maps gives you the directions to get there starting with the quickest route. You can download it on your phone or use the one built into the google website. This helps whenever you don't know directions like me.

Google Meets is an online video calling product. It allows multiple people to be in a call at once. Though its very laggy somethings and freezes your eniter computer making you have to restart it. This product has many other competitors like zoom. Many people have mixed feelings about Google Meet which is fair.

Google Earth is an app created by Google. It uses satlites to let the user view the earth from a bird's eye point of view. This also includes Google Streetview which is the same things, but you also get to explore the earth from the angle of a driving car. This can be accessed by downloading the app on your phone or by using the google website.

Google Classroom is an app that allows teachers to hand out assignments to their students. It is widely used and has a smooth design. It is easy to navigate and the classrooms are also well orginaized, unless its a "boomer" teacher that doesn't know how to use it.

<div>
Google mail or Gmail for short is Google's version of email. It's by far the most popular or atleast I think it is and is very easy to navigate. It is used for personal and bussiness realted purposes. It's also free and you don't have to pay for it too, all you need is a google account and you automaticly get it. It also helps you keep track of things from school or work.

<div>
I rate all of these the same and under the category of Google Drive, because Slides, Docs, and Sheets are all part of the Drive. The Drive is kind of like Google's version of a cloud even though they have something called Google Cloud, but the Drive is free and lets you keep up to 15 Gigabaytes of storage, unless you pay for more. Docs allows you to create and write documents to send to other people or be used as giving homework to children. Slides is Google's version of Powerpoint, but looks more smooth and is easier to navigate. It allows you to create slide presentaions for school or work. Google sheets is more confusing, but it's very useful if you know how to use it unlike me. It can work as a caculator or a decoder. Most people use it as a way to create tables and graphs, which it's good at.
